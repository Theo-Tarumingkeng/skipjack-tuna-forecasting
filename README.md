# Skipjack-Tuna-Forecasting

An end to end forecasting skipjack tuna catches in the Sulawesi Sea project using Linear Regression & Recurrent Neural Network models, with a comparison of the performance of the two models.

## Dataset
The dataset used in this project is a merged data of daily catches of Skipjack Tuna with daily measurements of environmental variables in Sulawesi Sea from 2018 to 2022. The amount of data is 1770 rows.

The environmental variables contained in the dataset are:   
1. **Sea Surface Temperatures** (m/s)   
2. **Chlorophyll Levels** (mg/m^3) 
3. **Northward & Eastward Wind Velocities** (m/s) 
4. **Northward & Eastward Seawater Velocities** (m/s)
5. **Wind & Seawater Magnitude** without considering direction (m/s)
6. **Wind & Seawater Direction**
7. **Fishing season**
