# Skipjack-Tuna-Forecasting

An end to end forecasting skipjack tuna catches in the Sulawesi Sea project using Linear Regression & Recurrent Neural Network models, with a comparison of the performance of the two models.

## Dataset
The dataset used in this project is a merged data of catches of Skipjack Tuna with measurements of environmental variables in Sulawesi Sea, such as: 
1.**Sea Surface Temperature** 
2.**Chlorophyll Levels**
3.**Wind & Seawater Velocities**.
